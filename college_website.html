        <h2>About KEC</h2>
        <p>Kongu Engineering College, one of the foremost multi professional research-led Institutions is internationally a recognized leader in professional and career-oriented education. It provides an integral, inter-disciplinary education - a unique intersection between theory and practice, passion and reason. The College offers courses of study that are on the frontiers of knowledge and it connects the spiritual and practical dimensions of intellectual life, in a stimulating environment that fosters rigorous scholarship and supportive community. This Institute is a great possession of the committed Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' in Erode District, Tamilnadu. The noble Trust has taken the institute to greater heights since its inception in 1983 and has established the college as a forum for imparting value based education for men and women.</p>
        <p>The word 'Kongu' refers to a region of the southern state of India and the term 'Kongu Vellalar' specially means the agricultural community, predominated in the west of Tamilnadu, which was deprived of educational facility in those days. To achieve technical excellence in their rural areas, 41 philanthropists from different walks of life who realized the need for technical education for their region's economic strides, formed collectively a Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' and they tried to promote and develop equality of opportunity for the rich and the poor.</p>
        <p>Affiliated to Anna University Chennai,the college has completed more than three decades of dedicated service to the people of India and abroad in the field of Technical Education. The Institution has an area of 167 acres of land richly endowed with beautiful greeneries. The college with its state-of- the- art infrastructural facilities and excellent academic records has earned recognition as one of the reputed educational institutions for men and women in India.</p>

        <h2>ALUMINI</h2>
        <p>The KEC Alumni Association has been envisaged to foster a closely knit network bridging the gap between young budding KECians and the accomplished Alumni. Our Alumni have made us proud time and again by achieving laurels round the globe and we wish to showcase the same to our entire KEC family. I strongly believe that the more rooted we are, the stronger we grow in life. The Alumni is a strong force that binds us with our roots of wisdom. The illustrious journey of our institution is because of our dynamic students. KEC considers you as its brand ambassador as well as its torch bearer.  Our doors are always open to congregate the professional knowledge and experience of our alumni within, to move ahead jointly with confidence. Without your support, we are incomplete. We can do wonders together. The KEC Alumni Association will be the platform for all the KECians to connect, communicate and converge.</p>
